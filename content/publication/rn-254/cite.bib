 abstract = {Neural networks excel at capturing local spatial patterns through convolutional modules, but they may struggle to identify and effectively utilize the morphological and amplitude periodic nature of physiological signals. In this work, we propose a novel network named filtering module fully convolutional network (FM-FCN), which fuses traditional filtering techniques with neural networks to amplify physiological signals and suppress noise. First, instead of using a fully connected layer, we use an FCN to preserve the time-dimensional correlation information of physiological signals, enabling multiple cycles of signals in the network and providing a basis for signal processing. Second, we introduce the FM as a network module that adapts to eliminate unwanted interference, leveraging the structure of the filter. This approach builds a bridge between deep learning and signal processing methodologies. Finally, we evaluate the performance of FM-FCN using remote photoplethysmography. Experimental results demonstrate that FM-FCN outperforms the second-ranked method in terms of both blood volume pulse (BVP) signal and heart rate (HR) accuracy. It substantially improves the quality of BVP waveform reconstruction, with a decrease of 20.23% in mean absolute error (MAE) and an increase of 79.95% in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Regarding HR estimation accuracy, FM-FCN achieves a decrease of 35.85% in MAE, 29.65% in error standard deviation, and 32.88% decrease in 95% limits of agreement width, meeting clinical standards for HR accuracy requirements. The results highlight its potential in improving the accuracy and reliability of vital sign measurement through high-quality BVP signal extraction.
