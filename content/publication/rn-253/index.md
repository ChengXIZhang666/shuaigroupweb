abstract: Cardiovascular disease management often involves adjusting medication dosage
  based on changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals' waveform and rhythm. However,
  the diagnostic utility of ECG signals is often hindered by various types of noise
  interference. In this work, we propose a novel filter based on a multi-engine evolution
  framework named MEAs-Filter to address this issue. Our approach eliminates the need
  for predefined dimensions and allows adaptation to diverse ECG morphologies. By
  leveraging state-of-the-art optimization algorithms as evolution engine and incorporating
  prior information inputs from classical filters, MEAs-Filter achieves superior performance
  while minimizing order. We evaluate the effectiveness of MEAs-Filter on a real ECG
  database and compare it against commonly used filters such as the Butterworth, Chebyshev
  filters, and evolution algorithm-based (EA-based) filters. The experimental results
  indicate that MEAs-Filter outperforms other filters by achieving a reduction of
  approximately 30% to 60% in terms of the loss function compared to the other algorithms.
  In denoising experiments conducted on ECG waveforms across various scenarios, MEAs-Filter
  demonstrates an improvement of approximately 20% in signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio
  and a 9% improvement in correlation. Moreover, it does not exhibit higher losses
  of the R-wave compared to other filters. These findings highlight the potential
  of MEAs-Filter as a valuable tool for high-fidelity extraction of ECG signals, enabling
  accurate diagnosis in the field of cardiovascular diseases.
