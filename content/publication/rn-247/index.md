abstract: Cell migration, which is primarily characterized by directional persistence,
  is essential for the development of normal tissues and organs, as well as for numerous
  pathological processes. However, there is a lack of simple and efficient tools to
  analyze the systematic properties of persistence based on cellular trajectory data.
  Here, we present a novel approach, the entropy of angular distribution , which combines
  cellular turning dynamics and Shannon entropy to explore the statistical and time-varying
  properties of persistence that strongly correlate with cellular migration modes.
  Our results reveal the changes in the persistence of multiple cell lines that are
  tightly regulated by both intra- and extracellular cues, including Arpin protein,
  collagen gel/substrate, and physical constraints. Significantly, some previously
  unreported distinctive details of persistence have also been captured, helping to
  elucidate how directional persistence is distributed and evolves in different cell
  populations. The analysis suggests that the entropy of angular distribution-based
  approach provides a powerful metric for evaluating directional persistence and enables
  us to better understand the relationships between cellular behaviors and multiscale
  cues, which also provides some insights into the migration dynamics of cell populations,
  such as collective cell invasion.
