abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been implicated in many cell processes
  and diseases. YTHDF1, a translation-facilitating m6A reader, has not been previously
  shown to be related to allergic airway inflammation. Here, we report that YTHDF1
  is highly expressed in allergic airway epithelial cells and asthmatic patients and
  that it influences proinflammatory responses. CLOCK, a subunit of the circadian
  clock pathway, is the direct target of YTHDF1. YTHDF1 augments CLOCK translation
  in an m6A-dependent manner. Allergens enhance the liquid-liquid phase separation
  (LLPS) of YTHDF1 and drive the formation of a complex comprising dimeric YTHDF1
  and CLOCK mRNA, which is distributed to stress granules. Moreover, YTHDF1 strongly
  activates NLRP3 inflammasome production and interleukin-1beta secretion leading
  to airway inflammatory responses, but these phenotypes are abolished by deleting
  CLOCK. These findings demonstrate that YTHDF1 is an important regulator of asthmatic
  airway inflammation, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for allergic airway
  inflammation.
