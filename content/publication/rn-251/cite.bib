 abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity through high-throughput analysis of individual cells. Nevertheless, challenges arise from prevalent sequencing dropout events and noise effects, impacting subsequent analyses. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm, Single-cell Gene Importance Ranking (scGIR), which utilizes a single-cell gene correlation network to evaluate gene importance. The algorithm transforms single-cell sequencing data into a robust gene correlation network through statistical independence, with correlation edges weighted by gene expression levels. We then constructed a random walk model on the resulting weighted gene correlation network to rank the importance of genes. Our analysis of gene importance using PageRank algorithm across nine authentic scRNA-seq datasets indicates that scGIR can effectively surmount technical noise, enabling the identification of cell types and inference of developmental trajectories. We demonstrated that the edges of gene correlation, weighted by expression, play a critical role in enhancing the algorithm's performance. Our findings emphasize that scGIR outperforms in enhancing the clustering of cell subtypes, reverse identifying differentially expressed marker genes, and uncovering genes with potential differential importance. Overall, we proposed a promising method capable of extracting more information from single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, potentially shedding new lights on cellular processes and disease mechanisms.},
