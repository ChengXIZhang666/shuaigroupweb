abstract: X-rays, commonly used in clinical settings, offer advantages such as low
  radiation and cost-efficiency. However, their limitation lies in the inability to
  distinctly visualize overlapping organs. In contrast, Computed Tomography (CT) scans
  provide a three-dimensional view, overcoming this drawback but at the expense of
  higher radiation doses and increased costs. Hence, from both the patient's and hospital's
  standpoints, there is substantial medical and practical value in attempting the
  reconstruction from two-dimensional X-ray images to three-dimensional CT images.
  In this paper, we introduce DP-GAN+B as a pioneering approach for transforming two-dimensional
  frontal and lateral lung X-rays into three-dimensional lung CT volumes. Our method
  innovatively employs depthwise separable convolutions instead of traditional convolutions
  and introduces vector and fusion loss for superior performance. Compared to prior
  models, DP-GAN+B significantly reduces the generator network parameters by 21.104
  M and the discriminator network parameters by 10.82 M, resulting in a total reduction
  of 31.924 M (44.17%). Experimental results demonstrate that our network can effectively
  generate clinically relevant, high-quality CT images from X-ray data, presenting
  a promising solution for enhancing diagnostic imaging while mitigating cost and
  radiation concerns.
