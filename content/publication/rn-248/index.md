abstract: Cell migration is crucial for numerous physiological and pathological processes.
  A cell adapts its morphology, including the overall and nuclear morphology, in response
  to various cues in complex microenvironments, such as topotaxis and chemotaxis during
  migration. Thus, the dynamics of cellular morphology can encode migration strategies,
  from which diverse migration mechanisms can be inferred. However, deciphering the
  mechanisms behind cell migration encoded in morphology dynamics remains a challenging
  problem. Here, we present a powerful universal metric, the Cell Morphological Entropy
  (CME), developed by combining parametric morphological analysis with Shannon entropy.
  The utility of CME, which accurately quantifies the complex cellular morphology
  at multiple length scales through the deviation from a perfectly circular shape,
  is illustrated using a variety of normal and tumor cell lines in different in vitro
  microenvironments. Our results show how geometric constraints affect the MDA-MB-231
  cell nucleus, the emerging interactions of MCF-10A cells migrating on collagen gel,
  and the critical transition from proliferation to invasion in tumor spheroids. The
  analysis demonstrates that the CME-based approach provides an effective and physically
  interpretable tool to measure morphology in real-time across multiple length scales.
  It provides deeper insight into cell migration and contributes to the understanding
  of different behavioral modes and collective cell motility in more complex microenvironments.
