 abstract = {In the realm of quantitative proteomics, data-independent acquisition (DIA) has emerged as a promising approach, offering enhanced reproducibility and quantitative accuracy compared to traditional data-dependent acquisition (DDA) methods. However, the analysis of DIA data is currently hindered by its reliance on project-specific spectral libraries derived from DDA analyses, which not only limits proteome coverage but also proves to be a time-intensive process. To overcome these challenges, we propose ProPept-MT, a novel deep learning-based multi-task prediction model designed to accurately forecast key features such as retention time (RT), ion intensity, and ion mobility (IM). Leveraging advanced techniques such as multi-head attention and BiLSTM for feature extraction, coupled with Nash-MTL for gradient coordination, ProPept-MT demonstrates superior prediction performance. Integrating ion mobility alongside RT, mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and ion intensity forms 4D proteomics. Then, we outline a comprehensive workflow tailored for 4D DIA proteomics research, integrating the use of 4D in silico libraries predicted by ProPept-MT. Evaluation on a benchmark dataset showcases ProPept-MT's exceptional predictive capabilities, with impressive results including a 99.9% Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for RT prediction, a median dot product (DP) of 96.0% for fragment ion intensity prediction, and a 99.3% PCC for IM prediction on the test set. Notably, ProPept-MT manifests efficacy in predicting both unmodified and phosphorylated peptides, underscoring its potential as a valuable tool for constructing high-quality 4D DIA in silico libraries.},
