abstract: Inferring the developmental potential of single cells from scRNA-Seq data
  and reconstructing the pseudo-temporal path of cell development are fundamental
  but challenging tasks in single-cell analysis. Although single-cell transcriptional
  diversity (SCTD) measured by the number of expressed genes per cell has been widely
  used as a hallmark of developmental potential, it may lead to incorrect estimation
  of differentiation states in some cases where gene expression does not decrease
  monotonously during the development process. In this study, we propose a novel metric
  called single-cell transcriptional complexity (SCTC), which draws on insights from
  the economic complexity theory and takes into account the sophisticated structure
  information of scRNA-Seq count matrix. We show that SCTC characterizes developmental
  potential more accurately than SCTD, especially in the early stages of development
  where cells typically have lower diversity but higher complexity than those in the
  later stages. Based on the SCTC, we provide an unsupervised method for accurate,
  robust, and transferable inference of single-cell pseudotime. Our findings suggest
  that the complexity emerging from the interplay between cells and genes determines
  the developmental potential, providing new insights into the understanding of biological
  development from the perspective of complexity theory.
