   abstract = {N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been implicated in many cell processes and diseases. YTHDF1, a translation-facilitating m6A reader, has not been previously shown to be related to allergic airway inflammation. Here, we report that YTHDF1 is highly expressed in allergic airway epithelial cells and asthmatic patients and that it influences proinflammatory responses. CLOCK, a subunit of the circadian clock pathway, is the direct target of YTHDF1. YTHDF1 augments CLOCK translation in an m6A-dependent manner. Allergens enhance the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of YTHDF1 and drive the formation of a complex comprising dimeric YTHDF1 and CLOCK mRNA, which is distributed to stress granules. Moreover, YTHDF1 strongly activates NLRP3 inflammasome production and interleukin-1beta secretion leading to airway inflammatory responses, but these phenotypes are abolished by deleting CLOCK. These findings demonstrate that YTHDF1 is an important regulator of asthmatic airway inflammation, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for allergic airway inflammation.},
